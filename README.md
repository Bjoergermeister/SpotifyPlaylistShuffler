# Spotify Playlist Shuffler

A small website which uses the Spotify Web API to shuffle songs in a playlist.

A user can log in to his Spotify account, view his playlists and the songs in those playlists. He can also shuffle the songs randomly.

## Purpose

I once was in a situation where I needed to shuffle the songs in a playlist and the built-in shuffle functionality from Spotify didn't fit my needs, so I decided to look into the Spotify API and build this little project.

## What I learned

Other than that, this project's main purpose is to learn. Here's a list of things I learned about during my work in this project:

- Node.js
- Express
- OAuth2
- Handlebars
